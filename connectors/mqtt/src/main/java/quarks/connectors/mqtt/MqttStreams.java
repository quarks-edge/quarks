/**
 * {@code MqttStreams} is a connector to a MQTT messaging broker
 * for publishing and subscribing to topics.
 * <p>
 * For more information about MQTT see <a href="http://mqtt.org">http://mqtt.org</a>
 * <p>
 * The connector exposes all MQTT capabilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>multiple server URLs using tcp or ssl</li>
 * <li>connection ClientId control</li>
 * <li>connection username and password based authentication</li>
 * <li>TODO SSL connection client authentication Q:expose just key/trust store path/pw or whole setSSLProperties capability?  Related: expose setSocketFactory?</li>
 * <li>connection clean session control</li>
 * <li>connection keepalive control</li>
 * <li>operation/action timeout control</li>
 * <li>client last will and testament</li>
 * <li>connection in-flight message persistence control</li>
 * <li>per-published message control of topic, quality of service, payload and retain value</li>
 * <li>subscription topicFilter and maximum quality of service control</li>
 * <li>TODO multiple subscription topicFilters</li>
 * <li>access to received message's topic and payload.
 *     Omitting until there's a clear demand for it: the received msg's isRetained, qos and isDuplicate values.
 * <li>TODO dynamic server URLs control, operation timeout, keepalive control</li>
 * <li>TODO dynamic subscription list control</li>
 * <li>robust connection management / reconnected</li>
 * <li>TODO fix: client's aren't gracefully disconnecting (their close() isn't getting called) issue#64</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Sample use:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Topology t = ...;
 * String url = "tcp://localhost:1883";
 * MqttStreams mqtt = new MqttStreams(t, url); 
 * TStream<String> s = top.constants("one", "two", "three");
 * mqtt.publish(s, "myTopic", 0);
 * TStream<String> rcvd = mqtt.subscribe("someTopic", 0);
 * rcvd.print();
 * }</pre>
 * <P>
 * {@code publish()} can be called zero or more times.
 * {@code subscribe()} can be called at most once.
 * <p>
 * See {@link MqttConfig} for all configuration items.
 * <p>
 * Messages are delivered with the specified Quality of Service.
 * TODO adjust the QoS-1 and 2 descriptions based on the fact that we only
 * supply a MemoryPersistence class under the covers.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Quality of Service 0 - a message should be delivered at most once
 *     (zero or one times) - "fire and forget".
 *     This is the fastest QoS but should only be used for messages which
 *     are not valuable.</li>
 * <li>Quality of Service 1 - a message should be delivered at least once
 *     (zero or more times).
 *     The message will be acknowledged across the network.</li>
 * <li>Quality of Service 2 = a message should be delivered once.  
 *     Delivery is subject to two-phase acknowledgment across the network.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For {@code subscribe()}, the QoS is the maximum QoS used for a message.
 * If a message was published with a QoS less then the subscribe's QoS,
 * the message will be received with the published QoS,
 * otherwise it will be received with the subscribe's QoS.
