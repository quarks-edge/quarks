/**
 * A {@code Tester} adds the ability to test a topology in a test framework such

 * 
 * The main feature is the ability to capture tuples from a {@link TStream} in
 * order to perform some form of verification on them. There are two mechanisms
 * to perform verifications:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>did the stream produce the correct number of tuples.</LI>
 * <LI>did the stream produce the correct tuples.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * Currently, only streams that are instances of
 * {@code TStream<String>} can have conditions or handlers attached.
 * <P>
 * A {@code Tester} modifies its {@link Topology} to achieve the above.
