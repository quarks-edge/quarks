Sample MQTT Publisher and Subscriber topology applications.

By default, the following MQTT broker configuration is assumed:
- the broker's connection URL is tcp://localhost:1883
- the broker is configured for no authentication

See http://mqtt.org for the code and setup information for
a mqtt broker.

The source code for the samples is in the <quarks-release>/samples directory.

Running the simple sample
-------------------------

Modify the mqtt.properties file if required.

# run the simple sample subscriber
# the subscriber runs forever printing out each received message
$ ./runmqttsample.sh sub

# run the simple sample publisher
# the publisher runs forever printing out each published message
$ ./runmqttsample.sh pub

Running the fully configurable clients

# To see how to specify different values:
$ ./runmqttclient.sh -h

# run the subscriber client
