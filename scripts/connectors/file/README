Sample File Streams connector topology applications.

The file writer application writes a stream's tuples to files.

The file reader application watches a directory for files and reads their
contents into a stream of tuples.

The source code for the samples is in the <quarks-release>/samples directory.

Use:

# create a new directory for the sample to use
$ mkdir /tmp/fileSample

# run the sample file watcher / reader
# the reader runs forever printing out content from files read
$ ./runfilesample.sh reader /tmp/fileSample

# run the sample file writer
# the writer runs forever printing out each generated tuple
$ ./runfilesample.sh writer /tmp/fileSample
