# MQTT Device and Connector configuration info.
#
# MQTT Device -- See quarks.connectors.mqtt.device.MqttDevice for all
# of the properties.
#
# An optional topic prefix.  It can be used to isolate users or applications
# in shared MQTT broker configurations.  By default it is incorporated
# into device topics and the MQTT clientId.
# If you use a public MQTT broker you may want to change the topic
# prefix so it is still unique for you but doesn't include the
# user name or application name.
mqttDevice.topic.prefix=ibm.xyzzy-streams.samples/user/{user.name}/{application.name}/
#
# The device id used for identifying the device's events and commands
# in the MQTT topic namespace.
# By default it also gets incorporated into the MQTT clientId value.
mqttDevice.id=012345
#
# The MQTT clientId.  Only one instance of a MqttDevice can connect
# to the MQTT broker with a given clientId.
#mqttDevice.mqtt.clientId={mqttDevice.topic.prefix}id/{mqttDevice.id}
#
# MQTT Connector  See quarks.connectors.mqtt.MqttConfig.fromProperties()
#
# The default configuration is for a local MQTT broker.
# See mosquitto.org for instructions on downloading a MQTT broker.
# Or use some other MQTT broker available in your environment.
mqtt.serverURLs=tcp://localhost:1883
#
# Alternatively, there are some public MQTT brokers available to experiment with.
# Their availability status isn't guaranteed.  If you're unable to connect
# to the broker, it's likely that it isn't up or your firewalls don't
# allow you to connect.  DO NOT PUBLISH ANYTHING SENSITIVE - anyone
# can be listing.

# Patterns for identifying which streams to trace to System.out
# To enable use include.csv and/or includes.regex.
# To exclude an otherwise included file, use excludes.csv and/or excludes.regex
#
# Some tracing labels
# sensor1.raw1khz,sensor1.j1khz,sensor1.j1hzStats,sensor1.outside1hzMeanRange*,
# sensor1.periodicLastN*
#
#stream.tracing.includes.csv=sensor1.j1hzStats
stream.tracing.includes.regex=sensor1.outside1hzMeanRange.*
#stream.tracing.excludes.regex=.*
#stream.tracing.excludes.csv=sensor1.raw1khz
